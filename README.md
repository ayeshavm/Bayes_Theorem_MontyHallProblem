# K2_Project1
This project is a coding simulation and proof of the Monty Hall problem, which shows that switching the door selection 
would give the contestant better chances of winning the car. 

This repository consists of Jupyter notebooks for the coding simulation, and another one for the proof, also the python scripts
for the coding simulation, which would show the result for simulation of the game without the swap, and another simulation with 
the door swap.
